# Sign-Language-Identification

This repository contains Python code for identifying sign language images using Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN).

The code uses the ASL Alphabet dataset from Kaggle. This dataset contains 27,000 images of 28x28 pixels, representing the American Sign Language (ASL) alphabet.

*Requirements*

The following packages are required to run the code:

* numpy
* pandas
* tensorflow
* matplotlib
* seaborn
* sklearn

*Usage*

To use this project, you can open the Sign Language Identification.ipynb notebook in Jupyter Notebook and run the cells sequentially.

The notebook contains code for:

* Loading the MNIST dataset
* Preprocessing the data
* Building a convolutional neural network (CNN) using Keras
* Training the CNN on the training set
* Evaluating the performance of the CNN
* Making predictions on new images

Results

The best model achieved an accuracy of 100% on the test dataset
